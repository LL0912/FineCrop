# FineCrop
This is an official implementation of FineCrop in our ISPRS 2025 paper <a href="https://authors.elsevier.com/c/1lbcd3I9x1uc1l">FineCrop: Mapping fine-grained crops using class-aware feature decoupling and parcel-aware class rebalancing with Sentinel-2 time series </a>.
The code is being organizing, and will be open before 1st September, 2025.
