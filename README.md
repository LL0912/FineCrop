# FineCrop
This is an official implementation of FineCrop in our RSE 2025 paper <a href="https://authors.elsevier.com/c/1jqlA7qzT3EZL">CROPUP: Historical products are all you need? An end-to-end cross-year crop map updating framework without the need for in situ samples </a>.
The code is being organizing, and will be open before 1st September, 2025.
